# Online-voting-Application
### - The basic idea of this system is to create an Online Voting System that will help to suppress deceive of the manual voting system and also the prior versions of ### online voting by camera for Face Recognition. We are also implementing location free voting system to the voters for whom it is not possible to come at the voting ### location (hometown). Here we propose a system that includes multiple layers of verification to ensure the reliability of the device which includes face verification ### and then OTP verification with validation data. Each voter can access to the system only when being recognized and checked with the given database of enlist voters. ### Once the corresponding face is matched with the information provided, the voter will be allowed to proceed for choosing their preferred candidate from the panel.
